      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <p>
        I am a 40-year-old man from Turkey who speaks Turkish, Norwegian and English and has a bachelor's degree in
        mathematics and science from the education system in Turkey. In addition, I have also completed a year of IT
        education at Vistula University in Poland (further education). I really enjoyed my job as a teacher and have
        worked both as a mathematics teacher, a science teacher and a mother tongue teacher in Turkey. I also worked as
        a principal for two years at a primary school there. I am currently continuing my career as a full stack
        developer at Clarusway bootcamp.

        wants to learn more, very high ICT competence, a yes person who has a positive attitude and likes to help
        colleagues, used to stress and loud noise.
        <br>
        My friends describe me as a willing to learn, confident, patient and future-focused person who easily adapts to
        new tasks and routines. I am keen to carry out my work accurately and am motivated by challenges. My future
        workplace will experience that I can work both independently and in a team, and that I am polite, reliable,
        responsible, sociable and like to learn and share. For me, a positive outlook on work is important and the
        desire to work with challenges is one of the biggest reasons for my career choice...
